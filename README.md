High Level Vision
FOR medical practices who need a way to create appointments, view patients' data and charts. The Medical Practice Management is a practice management portal THAT allows patients to schedule appointments recent and future, allows the staff to view Doctor's schedules and availability, and allows doctors to view patient records. UNLIKE other Medical Portal software products, Medical Practice Management focuses on accessibility and efficiency at a lower cost and faster process.

First Iteration


For the first iteration we are developing a UI and a charting page that displays all the patient’s information in an organise format.

Rationale for Backlogs

Create a GitHub repo
Create individual personas for all the stakeholders
Research for an entry level UI for Practice management
Collaborating with the other teams to understand their needs for any API that needs to be created first on our part.
Come up with a design for the charting module so that the patients data is displayed in a systematic manner.
Work on an API to share the data with other teams that have permission to do so.
Work on scheduling and sending clinical alerts.
Request personnel information from other teams to start on the charting module.
Multiple means of documentation(optional)

The rationale behind the backlog is to create a workflow that helps our team to determine what we can start working on as the first iteration of the project. We would like to be in sync with other teams to create any API that they might need in order to meet any requirements that they might require.
